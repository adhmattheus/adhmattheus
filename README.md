### Hi, there
🚀 I am a computer engineer, with experience as an analyst and developer, navigating the waves of digital innovation.

💻 My playground includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, .NET and Node.js. Not forgetting databases, which are key pieces in the software development puzzle!

🌱 My goal is to solidify my knowledge in these technologies to create digital experiences that add value to the user, making people's lives better through technology, in addition to being attentive to the digital market and its continuous evolution.

🔍 I am always looking for challenges that boost my personal and professional growth. I believe that continuous learning and teamwork are the key to staying relevant in the world of technology.
